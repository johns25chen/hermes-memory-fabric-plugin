# Hermes Memory Bench

Hermes Memory Bench is a read-only benchmark scaffold for proving that Hermes
Memory Fabric is more than a generic memory wrapper. It makes the evaluation
dimensions explicit, starts with deterministic local fixtures, and emits a
stable JSON report that can later be compared across memory systems.

All benchmark suites are deterministic, local, and read-only. They do not call
live Memory Fabric tools, external APIs, embedding services, or provider tools.
They do not write durable memory, write graph state, modify OpenClaw
configuration, write token files, write approval audits, invoke or implement a
real token write executor, create proposals, or create operation-ledger events.
The benchmark only reads local fixtures and writes the requested JSON report.

## Suites

`smoke` is the original v0.1 compatibility suite. It keeps the 37 existing
cases and verifies that the standalone plugin's read-only memory primitives and
governance pipeline still behave as expected.

`v02` is Hermes Memory Bench v0.2. It moves beyond smoke coverage and measures
whether Subspace Index and Recall Fusion v2 address memory bloat, project
isolation, rejection accuracy, explanation quality, risk gating, temporal
validity, contradiction routing, and no-write policy safety.

## Run

```bash
python -m benchmarks.hermes_memory_bench.run --suite smoke --output /tmp/hermes-memory-bench-report.json
```

```bash
python -m benchmarks.hermes_memory_bench.run --suite v02 --output /tmp/hermes-memory-bench-v02-report.json
```

## v0.2 Metrics

The `v02` aggregate includes these quality metrics:

- `selection_accuracy` — correct activation of relevant memories, including
  explicit high-risk allowance and current temporal fact selection
- `rejection_accuracy` — correct rejection of unsafe, archived, unrelated, and
  disallowed high-risk candidates
- `explanation_quality` — presence of selected/rejected memory ids, selected
  and rejected subspace ids, rejection reasons, scoring rules, and policy
- `subspace_isolation_score` — project isolation and archived subspace behavior
- `risk_gate_score` — high-risk rejection by default and selection only when
  explicitly allowed
- `temporal_conflict_score` — current fact resolution and contradiction review
  routing
- `no_write_safety_score` — evidence that the benchmark created no proposals,
  operation events, token files, approval audits, executor implementation or
  invocation, or provider tool exposure
- `overall_score` — mean pass score across the v0.2 cases

The `v02` fixture covers these dimensions:

- `recall_fusion_v2_selection_accuracy`
- `recall_fusion_v2_rejection_accuracy`
- `recall_fusion_v2_explanation_quality`
- `subspace_isolation_accuracy`
- `archived_subspace_rejection`
- `high_risk_rejection`
- `high_risk_allowed_when_explicit`
- `temporal_validity_resolution`
- `contradiction_review_routing`
- `no_write_policy_safety`

## Hybrid Retrieval Fusion v0.1

Hybrid Retrieval Fusion v0.1 lives in `agent.memory_retrieval_fusion` and
exposes `fuse_memory_retrieval(...)`. It is a deterministic, read-only scorer
for candidate memory records. v0.1 intentionally uses lexical matching instead
of external embeddings so benchmark runs are reproducible and do not call live
services.

Each result includes the original query, selected memories, rejected memories,
per-candidate scores, policy, and an explanation. The scorer always returns
rejected candidates with a reason and component scores; losing records are not
hidden.

Scoring dimensions:

- `semantic_score` — token-overlap similarity between query and candidate text
- `keyword_score` — exact token overlap plus exact query phrase match
- `entity_score` — entity id intersection
- `temporal_score` — current validity and recency, with expired records
  penalized
- `project_scope_score` — project match for scoped queries
- `source_trust_score` — provenance-bearing sources score highest
- `governance_score` — read-only and proposal-governed records score highest;
  unsafe write/config/graph/allowlist indicators are rejected
- `final_score` — deterministic weighted total

## Memory Recall Fusion v2

Memory Recall Fusion v2 lives in
`hermes_memory_fabric.memory_retrieval_fusion`. It exposes
`fuse_memory_retrieval_v2(...)`, `explain_memory_retrieval_v2_result(...)`,
and `summarize_memory_retrieval_v2_result(...)`.

v2 integrates Memory Subspace Index when a registry is provided: selected
subspaces boost matching candidates by subspace id, project scope, or agent
scope; rejected subspaces remain visible in the explanation. Unsafe governance,
unrelated project scope, archived subspace, and disallowed high-risk candidates
are rejected with component scores. Scoring dimensions are semantic, keyword,
entity, temporal, project scope, subspace, source trust, governance, risk, and
final score.

The smoke suite includes `memory_recall_fusion_v2`, proving that a matching
project subspace is selected, the matching memory wins, unrelated and archived
memories are rejected by default, and no durable memory write, graph write,
token write, approval audit, real executor invocation, or provider tool
exposure occurs.

The `v02` suite expands this into separate selection, rejection, explanation,
archived-subspace, high-risk gating, and no-write policy safety cases so the
quality metrics can identify which behavior regressed.

## Bi-temporal Fact Graph v0.1

Bi-temporal Fact Graph v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_bitemporal_fact_graph`. It exposes a deterministic in-memory
fact model for temporal fact reasoning without writing durable memory, the
Memory Graph, config, proposals, or operation-ledger events.

Fact records include domain validity (`valid_from`, `valid_until`) separately
from system timing (`system_created_at`, `system_invalidated_at`). The v0.1
operations normalize facts, select current project-scoped facts, supersede
facts by returning updated copies, detect contradictory subject/predicate/project
claims, and explain fact lineage so superseded historical facts remain visible.

The smoke suite includes `bitemporal_fact_graph`, proving that a newer valid
fact wins while the older historical fact remains explainable through lineage.

## Memory Subspace Index v0.1

Memory Subspace Index v0.1 lives in
`hermes_memory_fabric.memory_subspace_index`. It partitions Memory Fabric into
governed read-only domains for project, agent, risk, archive, global, and
custom scopes so future context composition can activate only relevant memory.

The smoke suite includes `memory_subspace_index`, proving that
`project:hermes-memory-fabric` is selected for a matching project context,
unrelated project subspaces and archived subspaces are rejected by default, and
no durable memory write, graph write, token write, provider tool exposure, or
real executor invocation occurs.

The `v02` suite adds an explicit project isolation case and reuses Subspace
Index through Recall Fusion v2 for archived and high-risk gating coverage.

## Contradiction Engine v0.1

Contradiction Engine v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_contradiction_engine`. It exposes deterministic read-only
classification for memory facts and candidates with relation labels:
`supports`, `updates`, `contradicts`, `unrelated`, and `needs_review`.

The engine imports `normalize_fact` from the Bi-temporal Fact Graph module, so
validity windows, system timestamps, source episode ids, provenance, confidence,
and governance metadata are preserved without mutating inputs. Contradictions
are flagged for review or later governed proposal handling; the engine does not
write memory, write the Memory Graph, modify config, approve allowlists, create
proposals, or create operation-ledger events.

The smoke suite includes `contradiction_engine`, proving that a candidate fact
which conflicts with an existing fact returns a review recommendation rather
than being merged directly.

## Memory Compiler v0.1

Memory Compiler v0.1 lives in `agent.memory_compiler`. It compiles normalized
Bi-temporal Fact Graph facts and Contradiction Engine groups into review-only
methodology and procedure candidates. The compiler detects stable repeated
claims, superseded lineage evolution, and contradiction groups without writing
durable memory, writing the Memory Graph, modifying config, approving
allowlists, creating proposals, or creating operation-ledger events.

Compiler output includes the project scope, input and current fact counts,
contradiction group count, extracted patterns, methodology candidate, procedure
block candidate, review recommendation, trace, and read-only policy. Candidates
always use `review_required` status and explicitly state that they have not
been applied.

The smoke suite includes `memory_compiler`, proving that facts can compile into
a review-only procedure candidate while preserving the benchmark schema.

## Memory Blocks v0.1

Memory Blocks v0.1 lives in `agent.memory_blocks`. It converts review-only
compiler output into deterministic memory block candidates that future agents
can inspect without applying them. Supported block types are `human_profile`,
`persona`, `collaboration_style`, `project_context`, `procedural_rules`,
`safety_policy`, `methodology`, and `current_task_state`.

Every candidate includes a deterministic `block_id`, `review_required` status,
source pattern and fact ids, confidence, validity, `proposal_only` mutation
policy, `direct_write_allowed: false`, and explicit read-only policy proving
that it does not write memory, write the Memory Graph, modify config, approve
allowlists, create proposals, or create operation-ledger events.

The smoke suite includes `memory_blocks`, proving that a compiler procedure
candidate becomes a review-only `procedural_rules` block candidate while the
JSON report schema remains stable.

## Memory Block Review Queue v0.1

Memory Block Review Queue v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_block_review_queue`. It wraps Memory Block candidates in
deterministic `pending_review` queue items so humans or agents can inspect them
later without applying blocks or creating any durable side effects.

Queue items include a deterministic `queue_item_id`, block identity, project
scope, priority, risk level, source pattern and fact ids, block validation,
recommended action, an immutable block snapshot, and explicit read-only policy.
Priority is deterministic: invalid blocks are highest, safety policy blocks are
high risk, methodology and procedural rules are medium risk, persona and
collaboration style blocks are medium risk, and project context and current task
state blocks are low risk.

The smoke suite includes `memory_block_review_queue`, proving that a
`procedural_rules` block candidate becomes a `pending_review` queue item while
the JSON report schema remains stable.

## Memory Review Decision Gate v0.1

Memory Review Decision Gate v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_review_decision_gate`. It evaluates pending review queue items
into deterministic decision candidates with labels `approve_to_proposal`,
`reject`, `request_more_evidence`, and `defer`.

Decision candidates include queue and block identity, reviewer, rationale, risk,
source ids, queue validation, decision validation, next-step recommendation,
queue item snapshot, and explicit read-only policy. The gate does not apply
decisions, create real proposals, write durable memory, write the Memory Graph,
modify config, or create operation-ledger events.

The smoke suite includes `memory_review_decision_gate`, proving that a sourced
`procedural_rules` queue item becomes an `approve_to_proposal` decision
candidate without creating a real proposal.

## Memory Proposal Draft Builder v0.1

Memory Proposal Draft Builder v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_proposal_draft_builder`. It converts approved review decision
candidates into deterministic `draft_review_required` proposal draft candidates
for a separate governed proposal flow.

Only `approve_to_proposal` decisions can produce valid drafts.
`request_more_evidence`, `reject`, `defer`, and invalid decision candidates
produce invalid draft candidates with explicit reasons. Drafts preserve the
block payload preview, source pattern ids, source fact ids, source decision
snapshot, validation, next-step recommendation, routing, and read-only policy.
The builder does not create real proposals, persist approvals, write memory,
write the Memory Graph, modify config, or create operation-ledger events.

The smoke suite includes `memory_proposal_draft_builder`, proving that an
approved procedural rules decision candidate becomes a
`draft_review_required` proposal draft candidate without creating a real
proposal.

## Memory Proposal Governance Gate v0.1

Memory Proposal Governance Gate v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_proposal_governance_gate`. It validates proposal draft candidates
and creates deterministic `governance_review_required` governance submission
candidates for manual governed proposal creation.

Only valid drafts with `proposal_status: draft_review_required` can produce
valid submission candidates. Invalid drafts, missing payload previews, or
missing source evidence produce invalid candidates with explicit reasons. The
gate preserves payload previews, source ids, draft validation, source draft
snapshots, routing, and read-only policy. It does not submit to governance,
create real proposals, apply proposal drafts, persist approvals, write memory,
write the Memory Graph, modify config, or create operation-ledger events.

The smoke suite includes `memory_proposal_governance_gate`, proving that a
valid proposal draft becomes a `governance_review_required` submission
candidate without creating a real proposal or governance submission record.

## Memory Governance Submission Packet v0.1

Memory Governance Submission Packet v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_governance_submission_packet`. It turns valid governance
submission candidates into deterministic `human_review_packet_required` packet
candidates for manual human review before real proposal creation.

Only valid governance submission candidates can produce valid packets. Invalid
submission candidates, missing payload previews, or missing source evidence
produce invalid packets with explicit reasons. Packets include source identity,
payload preview, evidence summary, deterministic human review checklist, risk
notes, source submission snapshot, validation, recommendation, and read-only
policy. The packet builder does not submit to governance, create proposal
records, persist approvals, convert packets to real proposals, write memory,
write the Memory Graph, modify config, or create operation-ledger events.

The smoke suite includes `memory_governance_submission_packet`, proving that a
valid governance submission candidate becomes a `human_review_packet_required`
packet candidate without creating a real proposal.

## Memory Human Review Outcome Gate v0.1

Memory Human Review Outcome Gate v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_human_review_outcome_gate`. It turns human-review packet
candidates into deterministic `review_outcome_candidate` artifacts with outcome
labels `approve_real_proposal_creation`, `request_changes`, `reject`, and
`defer`.

Invalid packets produce `reject` outcomes, missing payload previews or source
evidence produce `request_changes`, and valid packets with payload preview plus
source evidence produce `approve_real_proposal_creation`. Explicit supported
outcome overrides are recorded only as read-only candidates. The gate does not
create real proposals, submit to governance, apply proposal drafts, persist
approvals, write memory, write the Memory Graph, modify config, or create
operation-ledger events.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_review_outcome_gate`, proving that a
valid human-review packet becomes an `approve_real_proposal_creation` outcome
candidate without creating a real proposal.

## Memory Real Proposal Creation Plan v0.1

Memory Real Proposal Creation Plan v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_real_proposal_creation_plan`. It turns an
`approve_real_proposal_creation` human-review outcome candidate into a
deterministic `manual_creation_plan_required` plan candidate.

Only valid approve outcomes with payload preview and source evidence can produce
valid plans. `request_changes`, `reject`, `defer`, invalid outcomes, missing
payload previews, and missing source evidence produce invalid plans with
explicit reasons. The planner creates plan candidates only; it does not create
real proposals, submit to governance, apply proposal drafts, persist approvals,
write memory, write the Memory Graph, modify config, or create operation-ledger
events.

The smoke suite includes `memory_real_proposal_creation_plan`, proving that a
valid `approve_real_proposal_creation` outcome becomes a
`manual_creation_plan_required` plan candidate without creating a real proposal.

## Memory Real Proposal Dry Run v0.1

Memory Real Proposal Dry Run v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_real_proposal_dry_run`. It turns a valid
`manual_creation_plan_required` plan candidate into a deterministic
`manual_final_preflight_required` dry-run candidate.

The dry run previews the proposal record, operation-ledger record, deterministic
target paths, payload, source evidence, and final preflight checklist. Invalid
plans, missing payload previews, missing source evidence, or missing creation
steps/preflight checks produce invalid dry runs with explicit reasons. The dry
run creates preview candidates only; it does not create real proposals, write
proposal files, write operation-ledger events, submit to governance, persist
approvals, apply proposals, write memory, write the Memory Graph, or modify
config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_real_proposal_dry_run`, proving that a valid
manual creation plan becomes a `manual_final_preflight_required` dry run without
creating a real proposal or operation event.

## Memory Real Proposal Write Lock Gate v0.1

Memory Real Proposal Write Lock Gate v0.1 lives in
`agent.memory_real_proposal_write_lock_gate`. It turns a valid
`manual_final_preflight_required` dry-run candidate into a deterministic
write-lock gate candidate.

Valid dry runs with preview-only proposal, operation-ledger, and target-path
previews become `eligible_for_human_approval_token`. Invalid dry runs, missing
previews, missing source evidence, or preview artifacts with written/created
flags remain `locked` with explicit reasons. The gate creates write-lock
candidates only; it does not create real proposals, write proposal files, write
operation-ledger events, submit to governance, persist approvals, apply
proposals, write memory, write the Memory Graph, or modify config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_real_proposal_write_lock_gate`, proving that a
valid dry run becomes eligible for a separate human approval token flow without
creating a real proposal or operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Request v0.1

Implemented in `agent.memory_human_approval_token_request`. It turns an
`eligible_for_human_approval_token` write-lock gate candidate into a
deterministic `approval_token_review_required` human approval token request
candidate.

Invalid or locked write-lock gates, missing previews, missing source evidence,
or preview artifacts with written/created flags remain `locked` with explicit
reasons. The request candidate never issues real approval tokens, persists
approvals, creates real proposals, writes proposal files, writes
operation-ledger events, submits to governance, writes memory, writes the Memory
Graph, or modifies config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_approval_token_request`, proving that an
eligible write-lock gate becomes review-required without issuing a token,
creating a real proposal, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Review Gate v0.1

Implemented in `agent.memory_human_approval_token_review_gate`. It turns an
`approval_token_review_required` request candidate into a deterministic
`token_review_outcome_candidate` with outcome labels `approve_token_issuance`,
`request_changes`, `reject`, and `defer`.

Invalid or locked request candidates reject. Missing proposal record,
operation-ledger, target-path previews, or source evidence request changes.
Valid review-required requests with intact previews and source evidence become
`approve_token_issuance` candidates. Explicit supported outcome overrides are
recorded only as read-only candidates; the gate never issues approval tokens,
persists approvals, creates real proposals, writes proposal files, writes
operation-ledger events, submits to governance, writes memory, writes the Memory
Graph, or modifies config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_approval_token_review_gate`, proving that
a valid approval token request becomes `approve_token_issuance` without issuing
a token, creating a real proposal, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Issuance Plan v0.1

Implemented in `agent.memory_human_approval_token_issuance_plan`. It turns an
`approve_token_issuance` review outcome candidate into a deterministic
`manual_token_issuance_plan_required` plan candidate.

Only valid `approve_token_issuance` review outcomes with proposal-record,
operation-ledger, target-path previews, and source evidence can create a valid
plan. `request_changes`, `reject`, `defer`, invalid review outcomes, and missing
required previews or source evidence produce locked plan candidates. The plan
never issues approval tokens, persists approvals, creates real proposals, writes
proposal files, writes operation-ledger events, submits to governance, writes
memory, writes the Memory Graph, or modifies config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_approval_token_issuance_plan`, proving
that a valid `approve_token_issuance` review outcome becomes
`manual_token_issuance_plan_required` without issuing a token, creating a real
proposal, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Issuance Dry Run v0.1

Implemented in `agent.memory_human_approval_token_issuance_dry_run`. It turns a
valid `manual_token_issuance_plan_required` plan candidate into a deterministic
`manual_token_issuance_final_preflight_required` dry-run candidate.

The dry run previews the approval token record, approval audit record, token
target paths, inherited proposal and operation-ledger previews, and final token
preflight checklist. It never issues real approval tokens, persists approvals,
creates real proposals, writes proposal files, writes operation-ledger events,
writes token files, writes approval audit records, submits to governance, writes
memory, writes the Memory Graph, or modifies config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_approval_token_issuance_dry_run`,
proving that a valid token issuance plan reaches final manual preflight without
issuing a token, persisting approval, creating a real proposal, or creating an
operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Write Lock Gate v0.1

Implemented in `agent.memory_human_approval_token_write_lock_gate`. It turns a
valid `manual_token_issuance_final_preflight_required` dry-run candidate into a
deterministic `eligible_for_final_human_confirmation` token write-lock gate
candidate.

Invalid or locked token issuance dry runs, missing token/proposal/ledger/path
previews, missing source evidence, or previews that are not preview-only remain
`locked` with explicit reasons. The gate never issues real approval tokens,
persists approvals, creates real proposals, writes proposal files, writes
operation-ledger events, writes token files, writes approval audit records,
submits to governance, writes memory, writes the Memory Graph, or modifies
config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_approval_token_write_lock_gate`, proving
that a valid token issuance dry run becomes eligible for a separate final human
confirmation flow without issuing a token, persisting approval, creating a real
proposal, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Final Confirmation Request v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_final_confirmation_request`. It turns an
`eligible_for_final_human_confirmation` token write-lock gate candidate into a
deterministic `final_confirmation_review_required` request candidate.

Invalid or locked token write-lock gates, missing token/proposal/ledger/path
previews, missing source evidence, or previews that are not preview-only remain
`locked` with explicit reasons. The request never issues real approval tokens,
persists approvals, creates real proposals, writes proposal files, writes
operation-ledger events, writes token files, writes approval audit records,
submits to governance, writes memory, writes the Memory Graph, or modifies
config.

The smoke suite includes
`memory_human_approval_token_final_confirmation_request`, proving that a valid
token write-lock gate becomes final-confirmation-review-required without
issuing a token, persisting approval, creating a real proposal, or creating an
operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Final Confirmation Review Gate v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_final_confirmation_review_gate`. It turns a
`final_confirmation_review_required` request candidate into a deterministic
read-only final human confirmation review outcome candidate.

v0.1 outcomes are `confirm_token_write`, `request_changes`, `reject`, and
`defer`. Invalid or locked requests reject; missing previews, source evidence,
or preview integrity failures request changes; valid review-required requests
with intact previews and evidence become `confirm_token_write`. The review gate
never issues tokens, persists approvals, creates real proposals, writes proposal
files, writes operation-ledger events, writes token files, writes approval audit
records, submits to governance, writes memory, writes the Memory Graph, or
modifies config.

The smoke suite includes
`memory_human_approval_token_final_confirmation_review_gate`, proving that a
valid final confirmation request becomes a confirm-token-write review outcome
candidate without issuing a token, persisting approval, creating a real
proposal, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Write Execution Plan v0.1

Implemented in `agent.memory_human_approval_token_write_execution_plan`. It
turns a `confirm_token_write` final confirmation review outcome candidate into
a deterministic, read-only token write execution plan candidate.

Only a valid `confirm_token_write` outcome with intact previews and source
evidence becomes `manual_token_write_execution_plan_required`. Request changes,
reject, defer, invalid outcomes, missing previews, missing source evidence, and
preview integrity failures become locked plan candidates with explicit lock
reasons. The plan describes future token write steps and preflight checks, but
never issues approval tokens, persists approvals, creates real proposals, writes
proposal files, writes operation-ledger events, writes token files, writes
approval audit records, submits to governance, writes memory, writes the Memory
Graph, or modifies config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_approval_token_write_execution_plan`,
proving that a valid final confirmation review outcome becomes
manual-token-write-execution-plan-required without issuing a token, persisting
approval, creating a real proposal, writing token files, writing approval audit,
or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Write Execution Dry Run v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_write_execution_dry_run`. It turns a
`manual_token_write_execution_plan_required` execution plan candidate into a
deterministic, read-only token write execution dry-run candidate.

Only a valid execution plan with intact token, audit, proposal, ledger, target
path, payload, source evidence, and execution-control previews becomes
`manual_token_write_final_preflight_required`. Locked or invalid plans, missing
previews, missing evidence, missing controls, and preview integrity failures
become locked dry-run candidates with explicit reasons. The dry run previews
the exact token write payload, approval audit write payload, target paths, and
final preflight checklist, but never issues approval tokens, persists approvals,
creates real proposals, writes proposal files, writes operation-ledger events,
writes token files, writes approval audit records, submits to governance, writes
memory, writes the Memory Graph, or modifies config.

The smoke suite includes
`memory_human_approval_token_write_execution_dry_run`, proving that a valid
execution plan becomes manual-token-write-final-preflight-required without
issuing a token, persisting approval, creating a real proposal, writing token
files, writing approval audit, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Write Final Gate v0.1

Implemented in `agent.memory_human_approval_token_write_final_gate`. It turns a
valid `manual_token_write_final_preflight_required` execution dry-run candidate
into a deterministic, read-only final gate candidate with
`eligible_for_real_token_write_executor` status.

Locked or invalid execution dry runs, missing previews, missing source
evidence, missing final preflight checklists, preview integrity failures, and
final preflight integrity failures become locked final gate candidates with
explicit reasons. The final gate may route to a separate real token write
executor later, but v0.1 does not invoke that executor, issue approval tokens,
persist approvals, create real proposals, write proposal files, write
operation-ledger events, write token files, write approval audit records,
submit to governance, write memory, write the Memory Graph, or modify config.

The smoke suite includes `memory_human_approval_token_write_final_gate`,
proving that a valid write execution dry run becomes executor-eligible without
issuing a token, persisting approval, invoking the executor, writing token
files, writing approval audit, creating a real proposal, or creating an
operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Real Write Executor Contract v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_contract`. It turns a
valid `eligible_for_real_token_write_executor` final gate candidate into a
deterministic, read-only real token write executor contract candidate with
`real_token_write_executor_contract_required` status.

Locked or invalid final gates, missing previews, missing source evidence,
missing final gate checklists, preview integrity failures, and final gate
integrity failures become locked contract candidates with explicit reasons. The
contract defines future executor inputs, hard-lock checks, audit fields,
rollback rules, forbidden side effects, and the execution boundary, but v0.1
does not implement or invoke a real token write executor, issue approval
tokens, persist approvals, create real proposals, write proposal files, write
operation-ledger events, write token files, write approval audit records,
submit to governance, write memory, write the Memory Graph, or modify config.

The smoke suite includes
`memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_contract`, proving that a valid
write final gate becomes a real-token-write-executor-contract-required
candidate without issuing a token, persisting approval, invoking or
implementing the executor, writing token files, writing approval audit, creating
a real proposal, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Real Write Executor Contract Review Gate v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_contract_review_gate`.
It turns a `real_token_write_executor_contract_required` contract candidate into
a deterministic, read-only contract review outcome candidate.

v0.1 outcomes are `approve_executor_contract`, `request_contract_changes`,
`reject_contract`, and `defer_contract_review`. Valid required contracts with
intact previews, executor contract fields, and source evidence are approved
only for a later implementation plan. Locked or invalid contracts reject;
missing previews, missing executor contract fields, missing source evidence,
preview integrity failures, and contract integrity failures request changes.
The review gate does not implement or invoke a real token write executor, issue
approval tokens, persist approvals, create real proposals, write proposal files,
write operation-ledger events, write token files, write approval audit records,
submit to governance, write memory, write the Memory Graph, or modify config.

The smoke suite includes
`memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_contract_review_gate`, proving
that a valid contract becomes `approve_executor_contract` without issuing a
token, persisting approval, creating a real proposal, writing token files,
writing approval audit, invoking or implementing a real token write executor,
or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Real Write Executor Implementation Plan v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_implementation_plan`.
It turns an `approve_executor_contract` review outcome candidate into a
deterministic, read-only implementation plan candidate with
`real_token_write_executor_implementation_plan_required` status.

The plan defines future executor interfaces, planned module boundaries,
idempotency, filesystem safety, audit, rollback, tests, and forbidden actions.
Non-approved, invalid, incomplete, or integrity-failed contract review outcomes
become locked plan candidates with explicit reasons. v0.1 does not implement or
invoke a real token write executor, issue approval tokens, persist approvals,
create real proposals, write proposal files, write operation-ledger events,
write token files, write approval audit records, submit to governance, write
memory, write the Memory Graph, or modify config.

or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Real Write Executor Implementation Dry Run v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_implementation_dry_run`.
It turns a valid `real_token_write_executor_implementation_plan_required`
implementation plan candidate into a deterministic, read-only implementation
dry-run candidate with `real_token_write_executor_code_review_plan_required`
status.

The dry run previews future executor module boundaries, interfaces,
idempotency checks, filesystem safety checks, audit checks, rollback checks,
test harness shape, and readiness checklist. Invalid, locked, incomplete, or
integrity-failed implementation plans become locked dry-run candidates with
explicit reasons. v0.1 does not implement or invoke a real token write
executor, create executor source files, issue approval tokens, persist
approvals, create real proposals, write proposal files, write operation-ledger
events, write token files, write approval audit records, submit to governance,
write memory, write the Memory Graph, or modify config.

approval audit, invoking or implementing a real token write executor, creating
executor source files, or creating an operation event.

### Memory Human Approval Token Real Write Executor Code Review Plan v0.1

Implemented in
`agent.memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_code_review_plan`.
It turns a valid `real_token_write_executor_code_review_plan_required`
implementation dry-run candidate into a deterministic, read-only code review
plan candidate with `real_token_write_executor_code_review_gate_required`
status.

The code review plan defines future executor source-file review scope, required
future files, static analysis checks, security checks, write-safety checks,
test matrix, acceptance criteria, forbidden actions, and a plan checklist.
Invalid, locked, incomplete, or integrity-failed implementation dry runs become
locked code-review-plan candidates with explicit reasons. v0.1 does not create
executor source files, create executor tests, implement or invoke a real token
write executor, issue approval tokens, persist approvals, create real
proposals, write proposal files, write operation-ledger events, write token
files, write approval audit records, submit to governance, write memory, write
the Memory Graph, or modify config.

The smoke suite includes
`memory_human_approval_token_real_write_executor_code_review_plan`, proving

## Report Schema

The runner emits JSON with these top-level fields:

- `benchmark_type`
- `generated_at`
- `suite`
- `scores`
- `cases`
- `aggregate`
- `policy`

The `policy` object is part of the benchmark contract and must show:

```json
{
  "read_only": true,
  "would_write_memory": false,
  "would_modify_config": false,
  "would_write_graph": false,
  "does_not_create_operation_events": true
}
```

## Comparison Roadmap

Future versions can add adapters for Mem0, Graphiti, Letta, Cognee, and other
memory systems. Each adapter should answer the same case fixtures and report the
same dimensions, so Hermes can be compared on grounded recall, temporal
preference handling, source provenance, governance safety, project isolation,
contradiction handling, and latency. Live adapters must keep this benchmark's
safety contract: benchmark runs are read-only unless a separate human-approved
test harness explicitly permits isolated writes in a disposable environment.
